	<h4><p> <em>Mission Statement:</em> Nelson Acres will be focused on developing a farm that incorporates agricultural sustainability with
wildlife preservation; in other words, agriculture that works with nature instead of against it. It will
encourage community involvement through You Pick it products and eventually a CSA and
community-oriented activities such as a fall pig roast.</p></h4>
<h4><p> Nelson Acres has been in planning for ten plus years. To be close to kids, the farm will most likely be in
the Roanoke Valley in VA. The plan is for a twenty-acre property, but may need to be adjusted once the
property is identified and purchased. Financials during the Hobby Farm period will be meticulously kept
to provide data for commercial operations.  For the current farm plan, click <a href="NELSON ACRES.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a></p></h4>

	<h5 id="top2"><p><em>Product Plan</em></p></h5>
	<h5><p>First product will be developing You Pick It acreage and bee hives. As pastures are prepared,
livestock will be added one species at a time. After the initial five years and farm is balanced, will
explore a CSA.</p></h5>
<h5 id="swine"><p><strong>Heritage Swine:</strong> Our specific objectives are to determine a hardy forager breed that will take advantage of our wooded areas as well as our farm.  Heritage breeds are known to have a higher fat content giving a much better taste to the meat. Find more information at the <a href="http://www.livestockconservancy.org/index.php/heritage/internal/heritage-swine" target="_blank">Livestock Conservancy</a> Site.</p></h5>
<h5 id="ducks"><p><strong>Duck Eggs:</strong> Heather developed significant food intolerances, one of the most difficult to manage being chicken eggs.  Since then, the family has used duck eggs and found them to be slightly larger, creamier, and incredibly versatile.  Arrange for a tasting or check out heritage duck breeds on the <a href="https://livestockconservancy.org/index.php/heritage/internal/conservation-priority-list#Ducks" target="_blank">Livestock Conservancy</a> Site!</p></h5>
<h5 id="fruit"><p><strong>You Pick It Berries and Fruits:</strong> A You Pick It portion to the farm will increase customer involvement and community interaction.  This fresh suit will also be incorporated into treats from Four Seasons Bakery Check out the <a href="https://www.treesofantiquity.com/" target="_blank">Trees of Antiquity</a> website for heritage fruit trees and berries!</p></h5>
<h5 id="honey"><p><strong>Honey:</strong> The uses for honey are as numerous as the health benefits.  Besides providing honey for <a href="page4.html" title="Four Seasons Bakery">Four Seasons Bakery&trade;,</a> the bees will serve as pollinators for the You Pick It and property gardens.</p></h5>
