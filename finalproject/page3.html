	<h4><p>Nelson Acres is an experiment.  Although one of the objectives is to be profitable business, the main goal is to make it a self-sufficient farm, in that the processes on the farm require as little input from external resources as possible.  This is a lifestyle as well as an income.  Biodynamic processes will be evaluated and used as much as possible.  If you're interested in biodynamics, please visit the <a href="https://www.biodynamics.com/" target="_blank">Biodynamics Association</a> website.  For a short version, it's where nature, farmers, and agriculture work with each other intead of against.  This is beyond organic.  It views the farm as an ecological system benefiting all members, including wild life.  The ulimate goal is balance.</p></h3>

	<h4><p>To that end, this section is a blog on our progress and process.  From Fairfax, VA to Nelson Acres, I'll begin writing about the  journey.  It may be end up being a documented failure.  But even failures have their place in history.</p></h4>

<h4><p> BlogPost 1; Fairfax, VA; Jul 2020.  I actually started the original blog for Nelson Acres when my daughter was four, so about eleven years ago.  The picture next to this post is from those humble beginnings.  Since that year, my daughter and I religiously begin our seedlings in winter, for many years using our beloved dining room table, a chandalier with grow lights above it.  Two years ago, I finally invested in a real grow light stand, and they now fill the guest room.  Despite being helplessly enclosed in suburbia right now, we doggedly work at our tiny city farm.  We have had very little luck or success, but we have learned a lot.  The first is that little does well in clay.</p></h4>
	<h4><p>But last year we surprisingly had a few watermelons, a breed from <a href="https://www.southernexposure.com" target="_blank">Southern Exposure Seed Exchange </a> that is yellow inside.  Since most watermelons in the stores are seedless these days, I got to demonstrate to the kids how to spit the seeds out in the yard.  This year was an interesting experiment.  I let red lettuce, cucumber, beans, tomatoes, and a few others go to seed last year to see where they would pop up this year to help guide our planning.  Without planting any beans this year, we now have beans over-taking one of our gardens, running over hapless cucumbers, tomatoes, and our sole daisy in that garden.  Red lettuce looked more like a weed this spring as it covered a section of our front garden.  Too bad its bitterness is too much for my daughter.  Other plants are doing much better than last year, specifically our peppers, also from Southern Exposure.  Little to eat yet in July, but we are hoping to be canning in August.</p></h4>
